# For-Inf

This is a code to evaluate chiral nucleon-nucleon interactions under plane-wave basis, for infinite nuclear matter calculations.

### Method

To be brief, I use automated Plane-wave projection(aPWP) method, with the help of symbolic software Mathematica.

See Method.md if interested.

### Use

In src/*.cpp I provide an example in C++. You can compile and run it very quickly to know how to use.

"potential_chiral_nn" is the primary function needed for your own use.

Besides, in aPWP.nb, I provide my Mathematica code to generate the codes in the "potential_auto" function. You can try to run it yourself.
